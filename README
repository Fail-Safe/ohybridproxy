ohybridproxy - an mDNS/DNS hybrid-proxy based on mDNSResponder


** Abstract **

ohybridproxy is a mDNS/DNS hybrid-proxy which allows to exchange service
discovery and other mDNS-information usually limited to a single link
in routed networks with multiple links. This process is explained in
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cheshire-dnssd-hybrid-01 which inspired
this implementation.

** Features **

1. Translation of DNS requests 
	a) IPv4 + IPv6 support
	b) Filtering of link-local addresses
	c) UDP + TCP support

2. Support for multiple interfaces
	a) Individual domain setting per interface
	b) Automatic reverse lookup on all interfaces


** Compiling **

ohybridproxy depends on the following libraries:
* libubox: http://nbd.name/gitweb.cgi?p=luci2/libubox.git
* libdns_sd: http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder

ohybridproxy uses cmake:
* To prepare a Makefile use:  "cmake ." 
* To build / install use: "make" / "make install" afterwards.
* To build DEB or RPM packages use: "make package" afterwards.


** Firmware Integration **

Although ohybridproxy can be statically configured this can be cumbersome in a
network with several routers. It is advised to exchange and manage its
configuration through a network configuration protocol.
