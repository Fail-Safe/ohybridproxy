- implement cache (just to prevent bad effects of e.g. retransmissions
  if we have long queries)
 - use same result for multiple clients
 - positive / negative / inconclusive states
 (relatively short-lived)
 [ keep full lists per qtype ]

- also formalize the 'result' sending ; just dump of matching info in
  cache, unified for all backends
=> no need for ad hoc reply sending
=> need to have the original 'query' stored in the request (or at
least pointer to a cache entry)

- make sure NXDOMAIN handling is correct; currently perhaps sending
  the response back too keenly?

(to be able to do NXDOMAIN, we should by default do qtype=all, and
based on existence of non-matching record or not do NOERROR or
NXDOMAIN )
 
- OpenWrt mdnsd backend?
